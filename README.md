# Movies ETL
## Overview 

Amazing prime video is a platform for streaming videos and tv shows on Amazing Prime which is the world's largest online retailer. The Amazing Prime video team wants to develop an algorithm that can predict which low budget movies being released will become popular. This will help them buy the streaming rights at a bargain.
Amazing prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon to inspire the team, have fun and connect with the local coding community. A clean dataset of movie data will be provided and the participants will be asked to predict the popular pictures. The dataset for the Hackathon are to be created from scratch from two data sources: a scraped Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 stored as a JSON, and Kaggle data from MovieLens website that contains ratings data and megadata files stored in CSVs. 
The data will first be extracted from the two sources, transformed into one clean dataset and then, loaded into a SQL database.

In this module, python and pandas was used to perform data wranggling and then PostgreSQL used to store the finished data. The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)  process was used to create data pipelines.
